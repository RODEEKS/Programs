'''A list is a container which holds comma-separated values (items or elements) between square brackets where items or elements need not all have the same type.
In general, we can define a list as an object that contains multiple data items (elements).
The contents of a list can be changed during program execution. 
The size of a list can also change during execution, as elements are added or removed from it.'''
