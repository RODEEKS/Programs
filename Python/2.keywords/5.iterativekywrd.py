#Iterative and Transfer Keywords: for, while, break, continue, else

print('for loop to display first 5 numbers')
for i in range(5):
    print(i, end=' ')

print('while loop to display first 5 numbers')
n = 0
while n < 5:
    print(n, end=' ')
    n = n + 1

Output:

for loop to display first 5 numbers
0 1 2 3 4

while loop to display first 5 numbers
0 1 2 3 4

#break, continue, and pass: In Python, transfer statements are used to alter the programâ€™s way of execution in a certain manner.
